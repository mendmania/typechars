                Vinicius Jr. scored twice as Real Madrid demonstrated their dominance in LaLiga with a 4-2 triumph over 10th-placed Osasuna at the Estadio El Sader in Pamplona, further enhancing their league standing. Federico Valverde was also instrumental, providing three assists in a match that highlighted Los Blancos' tactical superiority and attacking prowess.

    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Vinicius Jr. stars as Real Madrid thrash Osasuna, add to LaLiga advantage</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">Vinicius Jr. scored twice as Real Madrid showed their dominance in LaLiga by defeating 10th-placed Osasuna 4-2 at the Estadio El Sader in Pamplona, with Federico Valverde racking up a trio of assists too.</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">The deadlock was broken in the fourth minute when their first attack of the game provided instant rewards as Vinicius Jr. picked up a loose ball, drove forwards and with his right-foot fired across the goalkeeper and into the far left corner to give Los Blancos the lead.</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">But it was only temporary as Osasuna dramatically hit back in the seventh-minute when Ante Budimir, wearing a mask, turned home from point-blank range after a quick counter-attack saw a ball crossed to him at the far-post.</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">That was as good as it would get for the home side though as 11 minutes later, Dani Carvajal restored the lead. Valverde showed great mobility and flexibility to cross from a disadvantageous position in the box and from around the penalty spot, the Real Madrid right-back was on hand to flick the ball into the top corner with the outside of his foot.</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">Carlo Ancelotti's side continued to dominate the remainder of the first half as Osasuna couldn't get into the game and that didn't change in the second half as two quick-fire strikes completely killed off the contest for the league leaders.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Real Madrid put the contest to bed</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">Brahim Diaz made it 3-1 in the 61st minute when Valverde doubled as a target man to win a flick on that set the away side through on goal with barely any defenders around.</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">From there, it was an easy job for Diaz to open himself up, wait for the goalkeeper to commit and slot into the right side of the goal to ensure the three points would be going back to the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">Then it got even sweeter as Vinicius Jr. scored again, with Valverde completing his treble of assists, with the Brazilian scoring the deftest of flicks from the six yard box to gently lift the ball over the onrushing goalkeeper in the 64th minute in a very classy goal.</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">Lucaz Vasquez had a goal ruled out for offside, before Iker Munoz then added a late consolation for the home side, but it proved to be nothing more as Real Madrid won out as 4-2 winners.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Vinicius' incredible season</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">The two strikes in today's game took Vinicius Jr.'s season total to 15 goals and six assists for Los Blancos, only being surpassed by the absent Jude Bellingham, with a combined total of 27 goal contributions.</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">The extra two goals also lifts Vinicius Jr. to be the seventh top scorer in LaLiga, level with Valencia's Hugo Duro and Barcelona's Robert Lewandowski. He trails Bellingham by four goals in the race for the golden boot.</p>
