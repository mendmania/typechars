                As we advance further into the digital age, the way we interact with devices continues to evolve.
                Typing, an essential mode of digital communication, is no exception. This article explores the
                cutting-edge innovations and trends in keyboard technology that are set to redefine our typing
                experience in the years to come.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Virtual Keyboards: A Glimpse into the
                Future</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">
                Virtual keyboards, projected onto surfaces or displayed on touchscreens, offer a versatile and portable
                alternative to traditional physical keyboards. These innovations promise to make typing more accessible
                and convenient, especially for mobile device users.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">AI-Driven Typing Assistants</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making its way into typing through smart assistants capable of
                predicting text, correcting errors, and even adapting to individual typing habits. This technology aims
                to increase typing efficiency and reduce errors, offering a more intuitive typing experience.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Ergonomic Designs for Health and
                Efficiency</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">
                As awareness of typing-related health issues grows, ergonomic keyboard designs are becoming increasingly
                popular. These designs, which prioritize comfort and reduce strain, are evolving to accommodate the
                natural movements of human hands and fingers.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Adaptive Keyboards: Personalized Typing
                Experiences</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">
                Keyboards that adapt to the user's typing style and preferences are on the rise. These adaptive
                keyboards can adjust key sensitivity, layouts, and even provide tactile feedback tailored to each user,
                enhancing both speed and accuracy.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Sustainability in Keyboard
                Manufacturing</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">
                With an increasing focus on sustainability, the future of keyboard manufacturing is shifting towards
                eco-friendly materials and processes. Innovations include biodegradable components and keyboards
                designed for easy recycling, reducing electronic waste.
