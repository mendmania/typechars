                As we spend increasingly more time in front of computers, understanding and implementing proper typing
                ergonomics has never been more essential. Ergonomic typing practices are crucial for preventing strain,
                reducing the risk of repetitive strain injuries (RSI), and ensuring long-term comfort and health. This
                article explores the fundamentals of typing ergonomics, offering guidance on setting up an ergonomic
                workspace and developing healthier typing habits.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Understanding Typing Ergonomics</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">
                Typing ergonomics refers to the study and application of a comfortable and efficient typing environment
                that promotes good posture, minimizes awkward movements, and reduces the risk of strain or injury.
                Proper ergonomics is not just about the equipment but also about how you use it.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Setting Up Your Ergonomic Workspace
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">
                An ergonomic workspace includes a chair that supports your lower back, a desk at the correct height, and
                a keyboard and mouse positioned to keep your wrists in a natural posture. Your screen should be at eye
                level and about an arm's length away to avoid neck and eye strain.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Adopting Healthier Typing Habits</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">
                Beyond hardware, adopting healthier typing habits is vital. Take regular breaks to stretch and rest your
                eyes, hands, and wrists. Practice typing gently to reduce the force on your fingertips and wrists, and
                ensure your hands and wrists are properly aligned with your keyboard.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Ergonomic Tools and Accessories</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">
                Consider investing in ergonomic tools and accessories such as split keyboards, ergonomic mouse devices,
                wrist rests, and standing desks. These can significantly enhance your typing ergonomics, comfort, and
                overall well-being.
